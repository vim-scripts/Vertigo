Vertigo.vim is a Vim plugin is based on a simple idea: that moving up and down using relative line numbers (e.g., 3j, 15k) is a very simple and precise way of moving around vertically, and shouldn't require your hands to leave home row.

To show how Vertigo works, let's look an example: say you want to go to some line that you can see (with relativenumber) is 14 lines down.

With this plugin, you'd press <Space>j to activate "jump mode." Vim then waits for two home-row keypresses representing a two-digit number, mapping asdfghjkl; to 1234567890. You then press af for 14, and just like that, you're 14 lines down. Easy! For one-digit numbers, just hit shift. (<Space>jF goes four lines down)
